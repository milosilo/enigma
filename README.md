# Enigma Python Implementations

## Introduction
This repository contains various Python implementations that simulate the basic workings of the historical Enigma machine used for encryption and decryption.

## Types of Implementations

### 1. Interactive Enigma Script
An interactive script that includes ASCII art, colored text, and educational print statements to provide an engaging and educational experience.

### 2. Streamlined Enigma Class
A standalone Python class that offers basic Enigma encryption and decryption functionality without any educational or interactive elements.

### 3. EnigmaLib
A Python package that includes the Streamlined Enigma Class and can be easily imported into other projects. The package also provides an Enigma module for easier use.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Optional Packages
- `colorama` for cross-platform color support (for Interactive Script)
- `termcolor` for colored text (for Interactive Script)

## Installation
For EnigmaLib, you can install it using pip:
```
pip install ./path/to/EnigmaLib
```

## How to Use
Each type of implementation has its own usage instructions. Please refer to the individual files for more details.
